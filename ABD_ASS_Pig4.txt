4. Implement a PIG script to 
a) Find the total count of participation of G 112

Batting = LOAD '/home/cloudera/Desktop/Batting1.csv' USING PigStorage(',') as (playerID:chararray,yearID:int,
stint:int,teamID:chararray,lgID:chararray,G:int,G_batting:int,
AB:int,R:int,H:int,B2:int,B3:int,
HR:int,RBI:int,SB:int,CS:int,
BB:int,SO:int,IBB:int,HBP:int,
SH:int,SF:int,GIDP:int,G_old:int);
dump Batting;
g_filter = Filter Batting by G==112;
g_filter_all = GROUP g_filter all;
total_count = foreach g_filter_all generate COUNT(g_filter.G);
dump total_count;


b) Find the player details with "david" 
david  = Filter Batting by(playerID MATCHES 'david.*');
dump david;

c) Find the average count of "NL"
NL_filter = Filter Batting by lgID =='NL';
NL_Group = Group NL_filter All;
NL_avg = foreach NL_Group Generate AVG(NL_filter.G_batting);
DUMP NL_avg;

d) Find the count of teams
team_count = group Batting by teamID;
team_group = group team_count All;
result_count = foreach team_group generate COUNT(team_count);
dump result_count;
